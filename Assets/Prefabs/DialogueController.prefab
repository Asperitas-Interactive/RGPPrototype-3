  - P1 to P2, do you copy? Over.
  - Ah yea, ah certainly. Roger that. Moving!
  - Hey how many guards did intel say there would be on duty at the moment?
  - "Ok so I\u2019m looking at a roster for today and it looks like there is y guards
    on\u2026\u2026\u2026"
  - Ok let me try something.
  - Rescue target located. Inspecting him now.
  - I really did not expect to be rescuing you today. Are you ok? Are you hurt in
    any way?
  - We would never let you do--
  - "Ah yea, ah right away\u2026.. Moving!"
  - On it.
  - "Shoot. It\u2019s locked."
  - Hmmm, I wonder if I could use this in some way.

    focus on getting to the end of that hallway for now."

    be heard on the way to the target."
  - "Only x amount. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t need to be guns blazing."
  - S**t
  - "There\u2019s three tangos in the opening around that corner. I can\u2019t take
    them all out quick enough. You\u2019re going to need to create a distraction
    of some sort."
  - "You\u2019re clear to move. Nice job. But move quick."
  - "Hold your position. The guards didn\u2019t notice. You\u2019re going to have
    to try again."

    to try something else."
  - "Crap. They must\u2019ve seen it get thrown. Hold tight for a moment."
  - "Crap. It seems like they heard it but aren\u2019t moving. Hold on."
  - "Roger that. I\u2019ll keep watch of the hallway."
  - "What\u2019s going on in there? We need to move to exfil now!"
  - Hey I see something on that desk over there that you could probably use to distract
    those guards. Try to get to it.
  - "I\u2019m out, reloading!"
  - All out.
  - "That\u2019s my last shot."
  - Headshot!
  - "Ohh, he\u2019s gonna feel that in the morning."
  - Nice cock!
  - "That\u2019s gotta hurt."
